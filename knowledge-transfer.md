Dialog Handling Improvements in UserBackupRefresh_Persist_1.ps1
Issues Addressed
WMI Query Syntax

Fixed incorrect syntax for querying drive space
Changed from DeviceID='C':' to DeviceID='C:'
Added proper error handling for WMI queries
Dialog Resource Management

Implemented proper resource cleanup using try-finally blocks
Added dialog disposal in finally blocks
Fixed memory leaks from unclosed dialogs
Dialog Result Handling

Standardized dialog result checking
Added proper error handling for dialog operations
Improved error reporting to users
Best Practices Implemented
Dialog Initialization
$dialog = $null
try {
    $dialog = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog
    # ... dialog setup ...
    
    if ($dialog.ShowDialog() -eq 'OK') {
        # ... handle results ...
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Warning ("Failed to show dialog: {0}" -f $_.Exception.Message)
}
finally {
    if ($dialog) {
        $dialog.Dispose()
    }
}
Error Handling

Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
Implemented proper error propagation
Added user-friendly error notifications
Resource Cleanup

Ensured all dialogs are properly disposed
Implemented consistent cleanup patterns
Added safeguards against resource leaks
Testing Considerations
When testing dialog implementations:

Check dialog disposal in all code paths
Verify error handling for all possible failure scenarios
Ensure consistent behavior across different Windows versions
Test cancel and close operations
Verify memory usage patterns
Future Improvements
Potential areas for future enhancement:

Add logging for dialog operations
Implement retry logic for transient failures
Add additional dialog customization options
Consider implementing async dialog operations
