# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initial setup and documentation of the project's memory bank. This establishes the foundation for tracking and managing the PowerShell User Data Backup/Restore Utility development.

## Recent Changes
1. Path Handling Improvements:
   - Implemented smarter C:\LocalData handling
   - Added automatic directory creation if missing
   - Improved path validation and error messaging
   - Enhanced browse dialog behavior

2. UI/UX Enhancements:
   - Fixed button text for Backup/Restore operations
   - Added clearer error messages for invalid paths
   - Improved path selection workflow
   - Added better state handling for backup/restore modes

3. Error Handling:
   - Added validation for non-existent paths
   - Improved error messages for path-related issues
   - Enhanced path access error handling
   - Added safeguards for directory creation

## Next Steps
1. Remaining Tasks:
   - Mapped Network drive needs to make a csv file
   - Each line of the CSV contains the drive letter, mapped_location, parsed by comma ,
   - Review @/documentation/UserBackupRefresh_Persist_1_original.ps1 implementation and use that
   - Ensure that the gpupdate ONLY occurs when restore button is pressed, directly after its pressed
   - make a new file with a function to execute all windows-config-manager actions, read @config-manager-actions.md for instructions on setup
   - The Restore files should always overwrite old files
   - If many files are backed up from a location, create a folder in the backup folder
   - Backed up files should keep there existing file name, never rename a backed up file
   - 

2. Future Development:
   - Core backup functionality completion
   - Core restore functionality enhancement
   - Special case handling (OneNote, Sticky Notes)
   - Network path validation improvements

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Verify backup functionality with default path
   - Test path selection behavior in both modes
   - Validate error handling for invalid paths
   - Check network drive and printer handling

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Memory bank established with core files
   - Clear separation of concerns in documentation
   - Mermaid diagrams for visual representation

2. **Project Organization**
   - Original script preserved in documentation folder
   - New implementation in root directory
   - Documentation folder for additional resources

## Current Considerations
1. **PowerShell Compatibility**
   - Syntax compatibility between PowerShell versions
   - Script formatting and parsing issues
   - Error handling approaches

2. **Code Organization**
   - Trade-offs between modular and monolithic approaches
   - Impact of file splitting on script performance
   - Maintenance considerations for multi-file structure

3. **Integration Points**
   - System service interactions
   - Application data handling
   - Network resource management

4. **Development Priorities**
   - Core functionality implementation
   - GUI development
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progress tracking and user feedback
