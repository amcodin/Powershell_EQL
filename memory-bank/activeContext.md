# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initial setup and documentation of the project's memory bank. This establishes the foundation for tracking and managing the PowerShell User Data Backup/Restore Utility development.

## Recent Changes
1. Initial Creation:
   - Created core memory bank files to document project
   - Split functions into separate files in src/ directory

2. Code Reorganization:
   - Moved XAML definition from Initialize-MainWindow.ps1 to main script
   - Modified code structure for better script scope handling
   - Simplified Chrome bookmarks handling

3. Bug Investigation:
   - Identified PowerShell parsing issues with script formatting
   - Attempted various approaches to resolve syntax errors

## Next Steps
1. Address Current Issues:
   - Inside function Initialize-MainWindow, rename buttons to Restore and Backup, instead of Yes and No
   - SelectedPath defaults to C:\LocalData when Selecting Backup or Restore
   - When selecting Backup, the SelectedPath doesn't need to be pressed if C:\LocalData exists and it will use that location
   - Mapped network drives, even if not connected, are saved

2. Future Work:
   - Consider alternative code organization strategies
   - Evaluate benefits of current modular approach
   - Plan potential rollback to single-file implementation

2. Plan development phases:
   - Core backup functionality
   - Core restore functionality
   - GUI implementation
   - Special case handling (OneNote, Sticky Notes)
   - Testing and validation

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Memory bank established with core files
   - Clear separation of concerns in documentation
   - Mermaid diagrams for visual representation

2. **Project Organization**
   - Original script preserved in documentation folder
   - New implementation in root directory
   - Documentation folder for additional resources

## Current Considerations
1. **PowerShell Compatibility**
   - Syntax compatibility between PowerShell versions
   - Script formatting and parsing issues
   - Error handling approaches

2. **Code Organization**
   - Trade-offs between modular and monolithic approaches
   - Impact of file splitting on script performance
   - Maintenance considerations for multi-file structure

2. **Integration Points**
   - System service interactions
   - Application data handling
   - Network resource management

3. **Development Priorities**
   - Core functionality implementation
   - GUI development
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progress tracking and user feedback
