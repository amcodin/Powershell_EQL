# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initial setup and documentation of the project's memory bank. This establishes the foundation for tracking and managing the PowerShell User Data Backup/Restore Utility development.

## Recent Changes
1. Initial Creation:
   - Created core memory bank files to document project
   - Split functions into separate files in src/ directory

2. Bug Fix:
   - Moved XAML definition from Initialize-MainWindow.ps1 to main script
   - Fixed script scope issue with XAML variable

## Next Steps
1. Continue refactoring:
   - Test the current implementation thoroughly
   - Identify any additional scope or variable issues
   - Plan for merging back into single file

2. Plan development phases:
   - Core backup functionality
   - Core restore functionality
   - GUI implementation
   - Special case handling (OneNote, Sticky Notes)
   - Testing and validation

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Memory bank established with core files
   - Clear separation of concerns in documentation
   - Mermaid diagrams for visual representation

2. **Project Organization**
   - Original script preserved in documentation folder
   - New implementation in root directory
   - Documentation folder for additional resources

## Current Considerations
1. **Script Architecture**
   - Maintaining proper variable scope across files
   - Ensuring dependencies are loaded in correct order
   - Managing shared resources (like XAML)

2. **Integration Points**
   - System service interactions
   - Application data handling
   - Network resource management

3. **Development Priorities**
   - Core functionality implementation
   - GUI development
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progress tracking and user feedback
