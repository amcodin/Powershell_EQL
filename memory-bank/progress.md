# Progress Tracking

## What Works
Project Infrastructure:
- Memory bank structure established
- Core documentation files created
- Project requirements documented
- Technical context defined
- System patterns outlined

Code Organization:
- Functions successfully split into individual files
- Function dependencies identified and managed
- Basic script structure established

Current Implementation:
- Window controls properly defined
- Event handlers set up
- Basic file operations structured

## What's Left to Build

   - [ ] User profile detection
   - [ ] File/folder selection
   - [ ] Network drive mapping
   - [ ] Printer configuration
   - [ ] Browser favorites
   - [ ] Outlook signatures
   - [ ] Special cases (OneNote, Sticky Notes)

2. **Restore Functionality**
   - [ ] Data restoration
   - [ ] Profile handling
   - [ ] Network connections
   - [ ] Configuration manager actions
   - [ ] Certificate management
   - [ ] Service handling

3. **GUI Development**
   - [ ] XAML interface
   - [ ] Progress tracking
   - [ ] User prompts
   - [ ] Error messaging

### Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Testing**
   - [ ] Core functions
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Edge cases

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] System interactions
   - [ ] Network operations
   - [ ] Application integration

3. **User Acceptance**
   - [ ] GUI functionality
   - [ ] Progress feedback
   - [ ] Error recovery

## Current Status
- Project planning phase
- Documentation structure complete
- Ready to begin implementation analysis

## Known Issues
1. **Active Issues:**
   - PowerShell parsing errors in main script
   - Script formatting causing syntax errors
   - Window initialization sequence needs review

2. **Under Investigation:**
   - Script scope variable handling
   - Cross-file function dependencies
   - PowerShell version compatibility impacts

## Next Milestone
1. Resolve Current Issues:
   - Fix PowerShell parsing errors
   - Validate script formatting
   - Test full execution path

2. Implementation Review:
   - Assess modular approach effectiveness
   - Consider reverting to single-file structure
   - Document lessons learned from refactoring

3. Future Planning:
   - Define stable implementation strategy
   - Establish testing framework
   - Plan deployment approach
