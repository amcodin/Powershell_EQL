# Progress Tracking

## What Works
Project Infrastructure:
- Memory bank structure established
- Core documentation files created
- Project requirements documented
- Technical context defined
- System patterns outlined

Code Organization:
- Functions split into individual files in src/
- XAML UI definition moved to main script
- Script scope and dependencies properly managed

## What's Left to Build

### Core Implementation
1. **Backup Functionality**
   - [ ] User profile detection
   - [ ] File/folder selection
   - [ ] Network drive mapping
   - [ ] Printer configuration
   - [ ] Browser favorites
   - [ ] Outlook signatures
   - [ ] Special cases (OneNote, Sticky Notes)

2. **Restore Functionality**
   - [ ] Data restoration
   - [ ] Profile handling
   - [ ] Network connections
   - [ ] Configuration manager actions
   - [ ] Certificate management
   - [ ] Service handling

3. **GUI Development**
   - [ ] XAML interface
   - [ ] Progress tracking
   - [ ] User prompts
   - [ ] Error messaging

### Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Testing**
   - [ ] Core functions
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Edge cases

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] System interactions
   - [ ] Network operations
   - [ ] Application integration

3. **User Acceptance**
   - [ ] GUI functionality
   - [ ] Progress feedback
   - [ ] Error recovery

## Current Status
- Project planning phase
- Documentation structure complete
- Ready to begin implementation analysis

## Known Issues
1. **Resolved:**
   - Fixed script scope issue with XAML variable by moving it to main script

2. **Under Investigation:**
   - Need to verify all script-scoped variables work correctly
   - Test cross-file function dependencies

## Next Milestone
1. Test refactored implementation:
   - Verify backup functionality
   - Test restore operations
   - Confirm GUI interactions
   - Check all dependencies resolved properly

2. Prepare for single-file merge:
   - Document current structure
   - Plan merge strategy
   - Identify potential conflicts
