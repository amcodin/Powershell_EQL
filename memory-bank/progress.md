# Progress Tracking

## What Works
Project Infrastructure:
- Memory bank structure established
- Core documentation files created
- Project requirements documented
- Technical context defined
- System patterns outlined

Code Organization:
- Functions successfully split into individual files
- Function dependencies identified and managed
- Basic script structure established

Current Implementation:
- Window controls properly defined
- Event handlers set up
- Basic file operations structured
- Default path handling implemented (C:\LocalData)
- Backup/Restore mode selection improved
- Path validation and error handling enhanced

## What's Left to Build

## Current Status
- Core functionality phase
- Path handling implementation complete
- Error handling improvements ongoing
- Testing phase beginning

## Known Issues
1. **Under Investigation:**
   - Network drive disconnection handling
   - Certificate management requirements
   - PowerShell version compatibility impacts

2. **Recently Resolved:**
   - ✓ PowerShell parsing errors fixed
   - ✓ Script formatting issues resolved
   - ✓ Path validation errors addressed
   - ✓ Default path handling improved

## Next Milestone
1. Resolve Current Issues:
   - Fix PowerShell parsing errors
   - Validate script formatting
   - Test full execution path

2. Implementation Review:
   - Assess modular approach effectiveness
   - Consider reverting to single-file structure
   - Document lessons learned from refactoring

3. Future Planning:
   - Define stable implementation strategy
   - Establish testing framework
   - Plan deployment approach
